# PRD: Job Seeker Authentication

## 1. Introduction/Overview
This document outlines the requirements for the Job Seeker Authentication feature, which allows users to create accounts, log in, and log out of the job portal. This is a fundamental feature that enables personalized experiences and secure access to job applications.

## 2. Goals
1. Provide a secure and user-friendly authentication system for job seekers
2. Allow new users to create accounts with minimal friction
3. Enable returning users to access their accounts securely
4. Ensure proper session management and security

## 3. User Stories
1. As a new job seeker, I want to create an account so I can save job searches and applications
2. As a returning job seeker, I want to log in to access my saved jobs and applications
3. As a job seeker, I want to log out to keep my account secure when using shared devices
4. As a security-conscious user, I want my password to be securely stored

## 4. Functional Requirements
1. The system must allow users to sign up with:
   - Email address
   - Password (with complexity requirements)
   - Basic profile information (name, location)
2. The system must verify email addresses before account activation
3. The system must allow users to log in with email and password
4. The system must implement proper session management
5. The system must provide password reset functionality
6. The system must log authentication attempts for security monitoring
7. The system must implement rate limiting to prevent brute force attacks

## 5. Non-Goals (Out of Scope)
1. Social media authentication (may be added in future versions)
2. Two-factor authentication (may be added in future versions)
3. Profile picture upload (covered in user profile feature)
4. Advanced profile editing (covered in user profile feature)

## 6. Design Considerations
1. **UI Components:**
   - Sign up form
   - Login form
   - Password reset flow
   - Email verification screens
2. **Error States:**
   - Invalid credentials
   - Account already exists
   - Password requirements not met
   - Email already in use

## 7. Technical Considerations
1. Implement secure password hashing (bcrypt or similar)
2. Use HTTPS for all authentication endpoints
3. Implement CSRF protection
4. Set secure, HTTP-only cookies for session management
5. Implement proper CORS policies
6. Rate limiting on authentication endpoints

## 8. Success Metrics
1. User registration completion rate
2. Login success rate
3. Password reset request rate
4. Account lockout rate due to failed attempts
5. Time to complete registration/login

## 9. Open Questions
1. Should we require email verification before allowing job applications?
2. What should be the password complexity requirements?
3. Should we implement account lockout after X failed attempts?
4. What is the session timeout duration?
