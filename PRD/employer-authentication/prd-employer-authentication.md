# PRD: Employer Authentication

## 1. Introduction/Overview
This document outlines the requirements for the Employer Authentication feature, which allows company representatives to create and access their employer accounts. This is a critical feature that enables employers to post jobs and manage applications while maintaining security and data integrity.

## 2. Goals
1. Provide a secure authentication system for employers
2. Verify employer identity and business legitimacy
3. Support multiple user roles within employer accounts
4. Ensure compliance with data protection regulations
5. Offer a smooth onboarding experience for employers

## 3. User Stories
1. As an employer, I want to create a company account to post job listings
2. As a hiring manager, I want to invite team members to help manage job postings
3. As an HR representative, I want to reset my password if I forget it
4. As an account administrator, I want to manage user permissions
5. As a security officer, I want to review login activity for our company account

## 4. Functional Requirements
1. **Account Registration**
   - Company information (name, address, website)
   - Business verification process
   - Primary contact details
   - Tax/VAT information (if applicable)
   
2. **User Authentication**
   - Email/password login
   - Password reset functionality
   - Account lockout after failed attempts
   - Session management
   
3. **User Management**
   - Invite team members
   - Role-based access control
   - Permission management
   - User deactivation
   
4. **Account Security**
   - Email verification
   - Password complexity requirements
   - Login notifications
   - Session timeouts

## 5. Non-Goals (Out of Scope)
1. Single Sign-On (SSO) integration
2. Multi-factor authentication (phase 2)
3. Advanced security features like IP whitelisting
4. Custom domain setup

## 6. Design Considerations
1. **Registration Flow:**
   - Step-by-step form
   - Progress indicator
   - Save & exit functionality
   - Clear error messages
   
2. **Verification Process:**
   - Email verification
   - Business verification steps
   - Pending verification state
   - Notification of verification status

## 7. Technical Considerations
1. Secure password storage (bcrypt or similar)
2. Email verification flow
3. Rate limiting on authentication endpoints
4. Audit logging of account changes
5. Data encryption for sensitive information
6. CSRF protection

## 8. Success Metrics
1. Employer registration completion rate
2. Time to complete verification
3. Login success rate
4. Password reset request rate
5. Account lockout rate

## 9. Open Questions
1. What documents are required for business verification?
2. Should we implement email domain verification?
3. What are the password complexity requirements?
4. How many failed login attempts before account lockout?
