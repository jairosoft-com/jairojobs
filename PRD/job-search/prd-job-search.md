# PRD: Job Search Functionality

## 1. Introduction/Overview
This document outlines the requirements for the Job Search feature, which enables job seekers to find relevant job postings through various search criteria and filters. This is a core feature that directly impacts user engagement and satisfaction.

## 2. Goals
1. Provide an intuitive and efficient way to search for jobs
2. Enable users to find relevant job postings quickly
3. Support various search criteria and filters
4. Deliver fast and relevant search results
5. Provide a seamless user experience across devices

## 3. User Stories
1. As a job seeker, I want to search for jobs by keywords so I can find relevant positions
2. As a job seeker, I want to filter jobs by location to find opportunities in my area
3. As a job seeker, I want to filter by job type (full-time, part-time, etc.) to find suitable positions
4. As a job seeker, I want to see recent job postings first
5. As a job seeker, I want to save my search criteria for future use

## 4. Functional Requirements
1. **Search Interface**
   - Search bar with autocomplete/suggestions
   - Location input with autocomplete
   - Filter panel for job types, salary range, experience level
   
2. **Search Functionality**
   - Keyword search in job titles and descriptions
   - Location-based search with radius filter
   - Filter by job type (full-time, part-time, contract, etc.)
   - Sort by relevance, date posted, or salary
   
3. **Search Results**
   - Display job title, company, location, and posting date
   - Show job type and salary range if available
   - Indicate if job is new or featured
   - Pagination for large result sets
   
4. **Saved Searches**
   - Allow users to save search criteria
   - Option to receive email alerts for new matching jobs

## 5. Non-Goals (Out of Scope)
1. Advanced search operators
2. Semantic search or AI-powered matching
3. Company reviews and ratings
4. Salary comparison tools

## 6. Design Considerations
1. **UI Components:**
   - Search bar with filters
   - Results list/grid view
   - Filter sidebar
   - Loading states for search results
   - Empty/No results state
   
2. **Performance:**
   - Implement debouncing for search input
   - Lazy loading for job listings
   - Cache frequent search results

## 7. Technical Considerations
1. Implement full-text search with database indexing
2. Geospatial queries for location-based search
3. API rate limiting
4. Caching strategy for popular searches
5. Mobile-responsive design

## 8. Success Metrics
1. Average time to find a job
2. Search result click-through rate
3. Number of filters used per search
4. Search conversion rate (search to application)
5. User satisfaction with search results

## 9. Open Questions
1. What is the maximum radius for location-based search?
2. Should we implement a "quick apply" feature in search results?
3. What default sorting should be applied to search results?
4. How many results should be shown per page?
