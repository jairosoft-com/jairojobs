# PRD: Job Application Process

## 1. Introduction/Overview
This document outlines the requirements for the Job Application feature, enabling job seekers to apply for positions directly through the platform. This feature is critical for converting job views into applications and requires a balance between collecting necessary information and maintaining a smooth user experience.

## 2. Goals
1. Provide a simple and efficient application process
2. Collect all necessary information from applicants
3. Support various application methods (quick apply, full application)
4. Ensure data privacy and security
5. Provide clear application status updates

## 3. User Stories
1. As a job seeker, I want to apply for jobs with minimal effort
2. As a job seeker, I want to track the status of my applications
3. As a job seeker, I want to save incomplete applications to finish later
4. As a job seeker, I want to know what information is required before starting an application
5. As a job seeker, I want to upload my resume and cover letter

## 4. Functional Requirements
1. **Application Methods**
   - Quick Apply: Basic info + resume upload

2. **User Experience:**

## 7. Technical Considerations
1. File size limits for uploads
2. File type validation

6. Backend validation of all inputs

## 8. Success Metrics
