# PRD: Job Details View

## 1. Introduction/Overview
This document outlines the requirements for the Job Details View feature, which allows job seekers to view comprehensive information about a specific job posting. This feature is a critical component of the job search experience, enabling users to make informed decisions about which positions to apply for.

## 2. Goals
1. Present all relevant job information in a clear, scannable layout
2. Enable quick assessment of job suitability through organized content sections
3. Provide easy access to application options
4. Display essential company information alongside the job details
5. Ensure the view is responsive and accessible across all device types

## 3. User Stories
1. As a job seeker, I want to see the complete job description with proper formatting so I can understand the role requirements.
2. As a job seeker, I want to view key job details (location, salary, job type) at a glance so I can quickly assess if the job matches my preferences.
3. As a job seeker, I want to see company information to evaluate potential employers before applying.
4. As a job seeker, I want to easily apply for jobs directly from the details page to streamline my application process.
5. As a job seeker, I want to save interesting jobs for later review when I'm logged in.
